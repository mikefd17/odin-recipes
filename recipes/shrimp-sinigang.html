        <h3>Description</h3>
             <p>Sinigang is one of the most popular and favorite Filipino dishes among locals. It is right there with Adobo although maybe not (yet) quite as popular internationally.</p>
            <p>Sinigang is simply the way of cooking meat in a stew or soup with a unique savory and sour taste. Different kinds of fruits that are bountiful in the Philippines are used to sour the soup. Tamarind is the most popular choice for most sinigang recipes.  Green mango, santol (lolly fruit), calamansi, guava are some other examples. Aside from the meat and souring agent, vegetables are also added.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned above, Sinigang na Hipon is just one of the many variations of Sinigang. It is called a different name depending on the souring agent and the meat that you are using. We also have a version where miso is added and it is usually made with fish as meat.</p>
